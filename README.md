## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
- It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis

## Conclusions
- Without Augmentation the accuracy and validation loss are very high
- Augmentation helps improve the Accuracy and solved the problem of over fittinh
